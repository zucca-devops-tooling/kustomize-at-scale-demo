# This policy is designed to be CPU-BOUND for performance testing.
# It forces Kyverno to perform a computationally expensive Regex match for
# every single resource processed by the `apply` command.

      This is a benchmarking tool. It consumes CPU cycles by running a complex
      regex known for 'catastrophic backtracking' against the metadata name
      of every resource.
